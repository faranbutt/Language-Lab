## Application Description

Begin by choosing from a vast array of languages. With a simple click on "Get random sentence", you're presented with a phrase or sentence that'll challenge your translation and pronunciation capabilities. Take a moment, translate the sentence in your mind, and then confidently speak it out loud in English using state-of-the-art microphone integration. "Did you make a mistake?" No worries. With our "Hear correct translation" feature, you can both listen to and visualize the accurate English translation, ensuring you learn and adapt. Ready for another round? Just hit "Get random sentence" and continue your linguistic adventure. Language Lab isn't just another translation app; it's your personal gateway to mastering the English language.
